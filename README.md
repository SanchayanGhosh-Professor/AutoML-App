# AutoML Project
Welcome to the AutoML Project! This application is designed to simplify the world of machine learning by tackling various supervised learning problems, including both regression and classification tasks. Whether you’re a seasoned data scientist or just starting out, this tool aims to make your modeling journey smoother and more efficient.

## Features
### Data Preprocessing:
No more headaches over messy data! The application automatically cleans, normalizes, and transforms your datasets, ensuring they’re ready for modeling. It tackles missing values and outliers, so you can focus on what matters most—getting accurate predictions.

### Model Selection:
Choosing the right model can be overwhelming. Our application evaluates multiple machine learning models and selects the best fit based on performance metrics. You’ll have the insights you need to pick the perfect model without diving deep into complex algorithms.

### Hyperparameter Tuning:
Get ready for optimized performance! The app automates the hyperparameter tuning process, using techniques like Grid Search and Random Search to enhance model accuracy. This means you can achieve the best results without the guesswork.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Gain valuable insights into your data with integrated EDA features. Visualizations help you understand data distributions, correlations, and key features, making it easier to spot patterns before you dive into modeling.

### User-Friendly Interface:
Built with Streamlit, the application offers an intuitive and interactive interface. You can easily upload your dataset, select target variables, and run models with just a few clicks. Real-time visualizations and performance metrics keep you informed every step of the way.
